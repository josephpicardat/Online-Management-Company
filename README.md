# About the files for Online Management Company

    This file contains three main file types: html, css, and images; and you will find the files to be clearly commented for easy understanding :)
    
    The project created in this repository was a challenge from Module 1 of UT Austin's Programming Bootcamp. We anaylze the the importance of comments and making sure we simplify the code to the best of our ability to decrease run times. I made the website run smoothly and redesigned some of the CSS and html classes to improve the performance of the build.
